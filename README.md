# Predicting Diabetes and choosing the best ML model

In this project, I will be using Machine Learning to predict whether a person has diabetes or not, based on patient's charecteristics such as blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), age, etc.

Then, I will choose the best model to build the predictions upon using scores to evaluate each model used.
